Hey there,

As you may already know, the original custom face for Gorilla Tag animation, GFX, and other elements unfortunately got taken down due to copyright issues. However, I've taken matters into my own hands and created a completely new version from scratch.

Introducing: "Monke Custom Blender Face"! This project is my solo endeavor aimed at providing a solution for Gorilla Tag enthusiasts who want to enhance their animations, GFX, and other aspects.

I'm excited to announce that this new custom face will soon be available for free on GitHub. Keep an eye out for updates as I finalize the details and prepare for the release.

Your interest and excitement mean a lot to me as I navigate through this project. Let's bring some new life to Gorilla Tag together!

Thanks for being a part of this journey!
